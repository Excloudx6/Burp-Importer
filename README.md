**Description:**    Burp Importer is a Burp Suite extension written in python which allows penetration testers to 
                connect to a list of web servers and populate the sitemap with successful connections.
                Burp Importer also has the ability to parse Nessus (.nessus), Nmap (.gnmap), or a text 
                file list of URLs for potential web connections.  Now you can hit multiple target servers at once!
                Use cases for this extension consist of web server discovery, authorization testing, and more!
